              Components are the reusable building blocks of our design system.
              Each component meets a specific interaction or UI need, and has
              been specifically created to work together to create patterns and
              intuitive user experiences.

              Frameworks are unique libraries with a universal purpose. They
              lean on existing components and patterns but contain specific
              components and patterns.
